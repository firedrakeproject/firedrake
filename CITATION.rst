Citing Firedrake
================

If you publish results using Firedrake, we would be grateful if you would cite the Firedrake user manual::

  @manual{FiredrakeUserManual,
    title        = {Firedrake User Manual},
    author       = {David A. Ham and Paul H. J. Kelly and Lawrence Mitchell and Colin J. Cotter and Robert C. Kirby and Koki Sagiyama and Nacime Bouziani and Thomas J. Gregory and Jack Betteridge and Daniel R. Shapero and Reuben W. Nixon-Hill and Connor J. Ward and Patrick E. Farrell and Pablo D. Brubeck and India Marsden and Daiane I. Dolci and Sophia Vorderwuelbecke and Thomas H. Gibson and Mikl√≥s Homolya and Tianjiao Sun and Andrew T. T. McRae and Fabio Luporini and Alastair Gregory and Michael Lange and Simon W. Funke and Florian Rathgeber and Gheorghe-Teodor Bercea and Graham R. Markall},
    organization = {Imperial College London and University of Oxford and Baylor University and University of Washington},
    edition      = {First edition},
    year         = {2023},
    month        = {5},
    doi          = {10.25561/104839},
  }

The simplest way to determine any additional relevant papers to cite is by asking Firedrake itself. You can ask that a list of citations relevant to your computation be printed when exiting by calling `Citations.print_at_exit` after importing Firedrake::

  from firedrake import *

  Citations.print_at_exit()

Alternatively, you can pass a command-line option `-citations` to obtain the same result.

Archiving your code with Zenodo
-------------------------------

In order to make your simulation results traceable and reproducible, we can provide you with a citeable archive of the exact version of Firedrake and its key dependencies that you used in your simulations. For information on how to do this see https://firedrakeproject.org/zenodo.html.

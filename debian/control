Description: 3D adaptive CFD model from Imperial College London
 Fluidity is a general purpose multi-phase CFD code capable of solving
 numerically the Navier-Stokes and accompanying field equations on
 arbitrary unstructured finite element meshes. It uses a moving finite
 element/spectral element method which allows arbitrary movement of
 the mesh with time dependent problems. It has a wide range of Finite
 element/spectral elements and full spectral methods which include
 many elements for mixed formulations.

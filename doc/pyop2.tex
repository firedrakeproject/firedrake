\section{Motivation}

This is part of an attempt at defining an implementation of OP2 that generates code at runtime (later referred to as PyOP2, for reasons which will be explained later). Coarsely, the compile-time translator iterates over \verb|op_par_loop| calls in the source code and performs the following operations:

\begin{itemize}
\item Generates a host stub for the kernel that is called.
\item Generates a wrapper around the OP2 kernel, that, for example, stages data into and out of shared memory.
\item Inserts a call to the original OP2 kernel inline in the generated wrapper, but leaves the kernel untouched.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The OP2 runtime manages:

\begin{itemize}
\item Transfer of data to/from the device.
\item Planning parallel execution.
\item Invoking the host stubs for kernels.
\end{itemize}

The question of which parts of the ROSE-based translator should be used arises. The position outlined in this document is that:

\begin{itemize}
\item The code that performs the generation of the host stub should be replaced by support in the runtime that calls the plan function and executes the kernel for each colour according to the plan.
\item The plan function from OP2 should be re-used as-is.
\item Since this leaves effectively no source-to-source transformation to perform (only inserting an essentially unmodified kernel into generated code) it should be possible to avoid the use of ROSE altogether. Should transformation need to be performed on OP2 kernels in future, this functionality may be added, either by integrating ROSE or using a simpler framework, since the operations performed in a kernel are limited to a fairly restricted subset of C/CUDA.
\item In order to speed development, maintainability and integration with MCFC and Fluidity, a sensible choice of language for the re-implementation is Python (hence PyOP2).
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this document describes the PyOP2 API, and how this API may be implemented. One may also refer to the implementation folder in the same repository as this document, for a skeleton API implementation and a complete (though non-functioning without an API implementation) version of the Airfoil code written using PyOP2.

\section{API}

\subsection{Declaring data}

Each data item is an instance of an object of one of the types \verb|Set|, \verb|Dat|, \verb|Mat|, \verb|Map|, \verb|Global| or \verb|Const|. Each of these objects may be constructed as follows:

\begin{description}
  \item[\texttt{Set(size, name)}] Construct a set with \verb|size| elements named \verb|name|. The name is for debugging purposes.
  \item[\texttt{Dat(set, dim, type, data, name)}] Construct a dat that holds a data item of type \verb|type| and dimension \verb|dim| for each element of the set \verb|set|. The data specifies the data to initialise the dat with, and may be a list or tuple. The name is for debugging purposes.
  \item[\texttt{Mat(row\_set, col\_set, dim, type, name)}] Construct a matrix which has entries that are the product of the two sets. The elements are of dimension \verb|dim| and type \verb|type|. The name is for debugging purposes.
  \item[\texttt{Map(from, to, dim, values, name)}] Construct a mapping from one set to another. The \verb|dim| of the map indicates how many different relations between the two sets the map holds. \verb|values| is used to initialise the mapping, and may be a list or tuple. The name is used for debugging.
  \item[\texttt{Global(name, val)}] Constructs a global value. The name is used for debugging purposes. \verb|val| is used to specify an initial value and may be a scalar, a list or a tuple.
  \item[\texttt{Const(dim, type, value, name)}] Construct a constant value of dimension \verb|dim|, type \verb|type|, and value \verb|value|. The name is used for debugging purposes.
\end{description}

\subsection{Declaring kernels}

To construct a kernel object with name \verb|name|, that implements the code string \verb|code|:

\begin{verbatim}
Kernel(name, code)
\end{verbatim}

The name is used only for debugging purposes. The code is an OP2 kernel, with the same semantics as are used in the current implementations of OP2.

\subsection{Invoking a parallel loop}

\begin{verbatim}
par_loop(kernel, iteration_space, *args)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
  \item[\texttt{kernel}] is a handle to a \verb|Kernel| object.
  \item[\texttt{iteration\_space}] is a handle to an \verb|IterationSpace| object.
\end{description}

Creating Firedrake-compatible meshes in Gmsh
============================================

The purpose of this demo is to summarize the
key structure of a ``gmsh.geo`` file that creates a
Firedrake-compatible mesh. For more details about Gmsh, please
refer to the `Gmsh documentation <http://gmsh.info/#Documentation>`_.
The Gmsh syntax used in this document is for Gmsh version 4.4.1 .

As example, we will construct and mesh the following geometry:
a rectangle with a disc in the middle. In the picture,
numbers in black refer to Gmsh point tags, whereas numbers in
read refer to Gmsh curve tags (see below).

   :width: 400px
   :align: center

The first thing we define are four corners of a rectangle.
We specify the x,y, and z(=0) coordinates, as well as the target
element size at these corners (which we set to 0.5).

.. code-block:: none

  Point(1) = {-6,  2, 0, 0.5};
  Point(2) = {-6, -2, 0, 0.5};
  Point(3) = { 6, -2, 0, 0.5};
  Point(4) = { 6,  2, 0, 0.5};

Then, we define 5 points to describe a circle.

.. code-block:: none

  Point(5) = { 0,  0, 0, 0.1};
  Point(6) = { 1,  0, 0, 0.1};
  Point(7) = {-1,  0, 0, 0.1};
  Point(8) = { 0,  1, 0, 0.1};
  Point(9) = { 0, -1, 0, 0.1};

Then, we create 8 edges: 4 for the rectangle and 4 for the circle.
Note that the Gmsh command ``Circle`` requires the arc to be
strictly smaller than :math:`\pi`.

.. code-block:: none

  Line(1) = {1, 4};
  Line(2) = {4, 3};
  Line(3) = {3, 2};
  Line(4) = {2, 1};
  Circle(5) = {8, 5, 6};
  Circle(6) = {6, 5, 9};
  Circle(7) = {9, 5, 7};
  Circle(8) = {7, 5, 8};

Then, we glue together the rectangle edges and, separately, the circle edges.
Note that ``Line``, ``Circle``, and ``Curve Loop`` (as well as ``Physical Curve`` below)
are all curves in Gmsh and must possess a unique tag.

.. code-block:: none

  Curve Loop( 9) = {1, 2, 3, 4};
  Curve Loop(10) = {8, 5, 6, 7};

Then, we define two plane surfaces: the rectangle without the disc first, and the disc itself then.

.. code-block:: none

  Plane Surface(1) = {9, 10};
  Plane Surface(2) = {10};

Finally, we group together some edges and define ``Physical`` entities.
Firedrake uses the tags of these physical identities to distinguish
between parts of the mesh (see the concrete example at the end of this page).

.. code-block:: none

  Physical Curve("HorEdges", 11) = {1, 3};
  Physical Curve("VerEdges", 12) = {2, 4};
  Physical Curve("Circle", 13) = {8, 7, 6, 5};
  Physical Surface("PunchedDom", 3) = {1};
  Physical Surface("Disc", 4) = {2};

For simplicity, we have gathered all this commands in the file
`immersed_domain.geo <immersed_domain.geo>`__. To generate a mesh using this file,
you can type the following command in the terminal

.. code-block:: none

    gmsh -2 immersed_domain.geo -format msh2

.. note::

   Depending on your version of gmsh and DMPlex, the
   gmsh option ``-format msh2`` may be omitted.

To illustrate how to access all these features within Firedrake,
we consider the following interface problem. Denoting by
:math:`\Omega` the filled rectangle and by :math:`D` the disc,
we seek a function :math:`u\in H^1_0(\Omega)` such that

.. math::

   -\nabla \cdot (\sigma \nabla  u) + u = 5 \quad \textrm{in } \Omega

where :math:`\sigma = 1` in :math:`\Omega \setminus D` and :math:`\sigma = 2`
in :math:`D`. Since :math:`\sigma` attains different values across :math:`\partial D`,
we need to prescribe the behavior of :math:`u` across this interface. This is
implicitly done by imposing :math:`u\in H^1_0(\Omega)`: the function :math:`u` must be continuous
across :math:`\partial \Omega`. This allows us to employ Lagrangian finite elements
to approximate :math:`u`. However, we also need to specify the the jump
of :math:`\sigma \nabla u \cdot \vec{n}` on :math:`\partial D`. This term arises
naturally in the weak formulation of the problem under consideration. In this demo
we simply set

.. math::

   [\![\sigma \nabla u \cdot \vec{n}]\!]= 3 \quad \textrm{on}\ \partial D

The resulting weak formulation reads as follows:

.. math::

   \int_\Omega \sigma \nabla u \cdot \nabla v + uv \,\mathrm{d}\mathbf{x} - \int_{\partial D} 3v \,\mathrm{d}S = \int_{\Omega} 5v \,\mathrm{d}\mathbf{x} \quad \text{for every } v\in H^1_0(\Omega)\,.

The following Firedrake code shows how to solve this variational problem
using linear Lagrangian finite elements. ::

   from firedrake import *

   # load the mesh generated with Gmsh
   mesh = Mesh('immersed_domain.msh')

   # define the space of linear Lagrangian finite elements
   V = FunctionSpace(mesh, "CG", 1)

   # define the trial function u and the test function v
   u = TrialFunction(V)
   v = TestFunction(V)

   # define the bilinear form of the problem under consideration
   # to specify the domain of integration, the surface tag is specified in brackets after dx
   # in this example, 3 is the tag of the rectangle without the disc, and 4 is the disc tag
   a = 2*dot(grad(v), grad(u))*dx(4) + dot(grad(v), grad(u))*dx(3) + v*u*dx

   # define the linear form of the problem under consideration
   # to specify the boundary of the boundary integral, the boundary tag is specified after dS
   # note the use of dS due to 13 not being an external boundary
   # Since the dS integral is an interior one, we must restrict the
   # test function: since the space is continuous, we arbitrarily pick
   # the '+' side.
   L = Constant(5.) * v * dx + Constant(3.)*v('+')*dS(13)

   # set homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on the rectangle boundaries
   # the tag  11 referes to the horizontal edges, the tag 12 refers to the vertical edges
   DirBC = DirichletBC(V, 0, [11, 12])

   # define u to contain the solution to the problem under consideration
   u = Function(V)

   # solve the variational problem
   solve(a == L, u, bcs=DirBC, solver_parameters={'ksp_type': 'cg'})

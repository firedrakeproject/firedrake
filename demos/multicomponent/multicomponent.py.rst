Multicomponent flow -- microfluidic mixing of hydrocarbons
===================================================

.. rst-class:: emphasis

    In this tutorial we demonstrate how Firedrake can be used to
    simulate multicomponent flow; specifically the microfluidic mixing of
    benzene and cyclohexane.

    The demo was contributed by `Aaron Baier-Reinio
    <mailto:baierreinio@maths.ox.ac.uk>`__ and `Kars Knook
    <mailto:knook@maths.ox.ac.uk>`__.

We consider a steady, isothermal mixture of benzene and cyclohexane in
a two-dimensional microfluidic container :math:`\Omega`.

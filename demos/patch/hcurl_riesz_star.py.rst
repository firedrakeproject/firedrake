Multigrid in H(div) and H(curl) also requires relaxation based on topological patches.
Here, we demonstrate how to do this in the latter case.::

  from firedrake import *

  base = UnitCubeMesh(2, 2, 2)
  mh = MeshHierarchy(base, 3)
  mesh = mh[-1]

We consider the Riesz map on H(curl), discretized with lowest order
Nedelec elements.  We force the system with a random right-hand side and
impose homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions::


  def run_solve(mesh, params):
      V = FunctionSpace(mesh, "N1curl", 1)
      u = TrialFunction(V)
      v = TestFunction(V)
      uh = Function(V)
      a = inner(curl(u), curl(v)) * dx + inner(u, v) * dx
      rg = RandomGenerator(PCG64(seed=123456789))
      L = rg.uniform(V.dual(), -1, 1)
      bcs = DirichletBC(V, 0, "on_boundary")

      problem = LinearVariationalProblem(a, L, uh, bcs)
      solver = LinearVariationalSolver(problem, solver_parameters=params)

      solver.solve()

      return solver.snes.getLinearSolveIterations()

Having done both :class:`~.ASMStarPC` and :class:`~.PatchPC` in other demos,
here we simply opt for the former. Arnold, Falk, and Winther show that vertex
patches yield a robust method.::


  def mg_params(relax):
      return {
          "ksp_type": "cg",
          "pc_type": "mg",
          "mg_levels": {
              "ksp_type": "chebyshev",
              "ksp_max_it": 1,
              **relax
          },
          "mg_coarse": {
              "ksp_type": "preonly",
              "pc_type": "cholesky"
          }
      }


  def asm_params(construct_dim):
      return {
          "pc_type": "python",
          "pc_python_type": "firedrake.ASMStarPC",
          "pc_star_construct_dim": construct_dim,
          "pc_star_backend_type": "tinyasm"
      }

Hiptmair proposed a finer space decomposition for Nedelec elements using edge
patches on the original Nedelec space and vertex patches on the gradient of a Lagrange space. The python type
preconditioner :class:`~.HiptmairPC` automatically sets up an additive two-level method
using the auxiliary Lagrange space in a multigrid hierarchy. Therefore, the overall multigrid relaxation composes the edge patches with the auxiliary space relaxation. For the latter, the residual on each level is restricted from the dual of H(curl) into the dual of H1 via the adjoint of the gradient, where a vertex patch relaxation is applied to obtain a correction that is prolonged from H1 into H(curl) via the gradient. ::


  def hiptmair_params():
      return {
          "pc_type": "python",
          "pc_python_type": "firedrake.HiptmairPC",
          "hiptmair_mg_coarse": asm_params(0),
          "hiptmair_mg_levels": asm_params(1),
          "hiptmair_mg_levels_ksp_type": "richardson",
          "hiptmair_mg_levels_ksp_max_it": 1,
          "hiptmair_mg_coarse_ksp_type": "preonly",
      }


Now, for each parameter choice, we report the iteration count for the Riesz map
over a range of meshes.  We see that vertex patches approach give lower
iteration counts than the Hiptmair approach, but they are more expensive.::

  names = {
      "Vertex Star": mg_params(asm_params(0)),
      "Hiptmair": mg_params(hiptmair_params()),
  }

  for name, parameters in names.items():
      print(f"{name}")
      print("Level | Iterations")
      for lvl, msh in enumerate(mh[1:], start=1):
          its = run_solve(msh, parameters)
          print(f"{lvl}     | {its}")

For vertex patches, we expect output like,

======== ============
 Level    Iterations
======== ============
  1        10
  2        14
  3        16
======== ============

and with Hiptmair (edge patches + vertex patches on gradients of Lagrange)

======== ============
 Level    Iterations
======== ============
  1        18
  2        20
  3        21
======== ============

and additional mesh refinement will lead to these numbers leveling off.

# Firedrake development environment image

This image provides a development environment for building Firedrake
and its dependencies. It does not provide an installation of Firedrake
but is intended for users who want to build their own version of
Firedrake. It also serves as a base image for
<https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/firedrakeproject/dev>, which does
provide the development version of Firedrake.

We do provide a helper script in this container to build Firedrake
automatically:

    update_firedrake

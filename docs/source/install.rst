Installing Firedrake
====================


.. _supported_systems:

Supported systems
=================

A :ref:`native installation<pip_install_firedrake>` of Firedrake is officially
supported on Ubuntu and ARM Macs (Intel Macs are no longer supported) though
it should be installable on any Linux distribution. Windows users are encouraged
to use WSL_ or one of Firedrake's
:ref:`alternative installation mechanisms<alternative_install>`.


.. _pip_install_firedrake:

Installing Firedrake using pip
==============================

A native installation of Firedrake is accomplished in 3 steps:

#. :ref:`Install system dependencies<install_system_dependencies>`
#. :ref:`Install PETSc<install_petsc>`
#. :ref:`Install Firedrake<install_firedrake>`

If you encounter any problems then please refer to our list of
:ref:`common installation issues<common_issues>` or consider
:doc:`getting in touch</contact>`.

.. _prerequisites:

Prerequisites
-------------

On Linux the only prerequisite needed to install Firedrake is a suitable version
of Python (3.10 or greater). On macOS it is important that homebrew_ is installed
and that the homebrew-installed Python is used instead of the system one.


.. _firedrake_configure:

firedrake-configure
-------------------

To simplify the installation process, Firedrake provides a utility script called
``firedrake-configure``. This script can be downloaded by executing::

  $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firedrakeproject/firedrake/refs/tags/2025.4.0.post0/scripts/firedrake-configure

Unlike the now deprecated ``firedrake-install`` script, ``firedrake-configure``
**does not install Firedrake for you**. It is simply a helper script that emits
the configuration options that Firedrake needs for the various steps needed
during installation.

To improve robustness, ``firedrake-configure`` is intentionally kept extremely
minimal and simple. This means that if you want to install Firedrake in a
non-standard way (for instance with a custom installation of PETSc, HDF5 or MPI)
then it is your responsibility to modify the output from ``firedrake-configure``
as necessary. This is described in more detail in :ref:`customising`.


.. _install_system_dependencies:

Installing system dependencies
------------------------------

If on Ubuntu or macOS, system dependencies can be installed with
``firedrake-configure``. On Ubuntu run::

  $ sudo apt install $(python3 firedrake-configure --show-system-packages)

which will install the following packages:

.. literalinclude:: apt_deps.txt
   :language: text

If on macOS you should instead run::

  $ brew install $(python3 firedrake-configure --show-system-packages)

which will install the following packages:

.. literalinclude:: homebrew_deps.txt
   :language: text

If you do not have one of these systems then these dependencies will need to
be installed manually.


.. _install_petsc:

Installing PETSc
----------------

For Firedrake to work as expected, it is important that a specific version of PETSc_
is installed with a specific set of external packages. To install PETSc you need to
do the following steps:

#. Clone the PETSc repository, checking out the right version::

   $ git clone --depth 1 --branch $(python3 firedrake-configure --show-petsc-version) https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc.git
   $ cd petsc

#. Run PETSc ``configure``, passing in the flags generated by ``firedrake-configure``::

   $ python3 ../firedrake-configure --show-petsc-configure-options | xargs -L1 ./configure

#. Compile PETSc by running the ``make`` command prompted by ``configure``. This
   will look something like:

   .. code-block:: text

      make PETSC_DIR=/path/to/petsc PETSC_ARCH=arch-firedrake-default all

#. Test the installation (optional) and return to the parent directory::

   $ make check
   $ cd ..

If you are using one of the
:ref:`officially supported distributions<supported_systems>` then these configure
options will include paths to system packages so PETSc can correctly find and
link against them. If you are not then you should pass the ``--no-package-manager``
flag to obtain a set of configure options where ``firedrake-configure``
pessimistically assumes that no external packages are available, and hence need
to be downloaded and compiled from source::

   $ python3 ../firedrake-configure --no-package-manager --show-petsc-configure-options | xargs -L1 ./configure

For the default build, running ``firedrake-configure`` with
``--no-package-manager`` will produce the flags:

.. literalinclude:: petsc_configure_options.txt
   :language: text


.. _install_firedrake:

Installing Firedrake
--------------------

Now that the right system packages are installed and PETSc is built we can now
install Firedrake. To do this perform the following steps:

#. Create a `virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_::

      $ python3 -m venv venv-firedrake
      $ . venv-firedrake/bin/activate

   This is optional but strongly recommended to avoid polluting your system Python
   environment.

#. Set any necessary environment variables. This can be achieved using
   ``firedrake-configure``::

     $ export $(python3 firedrake-configure --show-env)

   Which at a minimum will set the following variables:

   .. code-block:: text

      CC=mpicc CXX=mpicxx PETSC_DIR=/path/to/petsc PETSC_ARCH=arch-firedrake-{default,complex} HDF5_MPI=ON

   .. note::
      This command will only work if you have the right starting directory.
      Specifically it is assumed that PETSc was cloned into a *subdirectory
      of the current working directory* (i.e. ``<cwd>/petsc``). If
      you have exactly followed the instructions up to this point this should
      already be the case.

#. Install Firedrake::

      $ pip cache remove petsc4py
      $ pip cache remove firedrake
      $ pip install --no-binary h5py 'firedrake[check]'

   .. note::
      Though not strictly necessary to install Firedrake's optional
      dependencies with ``[check]`` it is recommended because it allows you
      to check that the install was successful (see
      :ref:`below<firedrake_check>`).

#. Firedrake is now installed and ready for use!


.. _firedrake_check:

Checking the installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend that you run some simple tests after installation to check
that Firedrake is fully functional. To do this, after the installation run::

  $ firedrake-check

This command will run a few of the unit tests, which exercise a good
chunk of the functionality of the library. These tests should take a
minute or less. If they fail to run for any reason, please check out
our list of :ref:`commonly encountered installation issues<common_issues>`
or consider :doc:`getting in touch</contact>`.

Note that for you to be able to run the tests you need to have installed
Firedrake with its optional test dependencies by specifying the ``[check]``
dependency group as shown :ref:`above<install_firedrake>`.


Updating Firedrake
------------------

Updating Firedrake involves following the same steps as above when
:ref:`installing Firedrake<install_firedrake>`. First, use ``firedrake-configure``
to set the right environment variables and then run::

     $ pip install --upgrade firedrake

Updating PETSc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update PETSc you simply need to run::

   $ cd /path/to/petsc
   $ git pull
   $ make

Note that this will only recompile PETSc's source code, not that of the external
packages, and so should be relatively quick. If your PETSc is sufficiently
out-of-date you may also need to rebuild the external packages by running::

   $ make reconfigure

.. _common_issues:

Common installation issues
--------------------------

No such file or directory: '/tmp/.../petsc/conf/petscvariables'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you encounter the error:

   .. code-block:: text

      FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/tmp/.../petsc/conf/petscvariables'

when running the ``pip install`` instruction this is usually a sign that the
environment variables ``PETSC_DIR`` or ``PETSC_ARCH`` are not set correctly.
You can check this by making sure that you can run the following command
without error::

   $ ls $PETSC_DIR/$PETSC_ARCH/lib/petsc/conf/petscvariables 

If this raises an error then you should re-``export`` the variables necessary to
build Firedrake as described :ref:`above<install_firedrake>`::

   $ export $(python3 firedrake-configure --show-env)

and try the install again.

Missing symbols post install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the installation completes but then you get errors regarding missing symbols
when you import Firedrake this is usually a sign that one of the Python bindings
packages used by Firedrake (h5py, mpi4py, petsc4py, slepc4py) is linked against
the wrong compiled library. This is usually caused by issues with caching.

To resolve the problem you should first remove any existing cached packages::

   $ pip uninstall -y h5py mpi4py petsc4py slepc4py
   $ pip cache remove h5py
   $ pip cache remove mpi4py
   $ pip cache remove petsc4py
   $ pip cache remove slepc4py

before re-running the instruction to install Firedrake.

.. _customising:

Customising Firedrake
=====================


.. _firedrake_archs:

Prepared configurations
-----------------------

``firedrake-configure`` provides a number of different possible configurations
(termed 'ARCHs') that specify how PETSc is configured and which external
packages are built. The currently supported ARCHs are:

* ``default``: the default installation, suitable for most users
* ``complex``: an installation where PETSc is configured using complex numbers

The different configurations can be selected by passing the flag ``--arch`` to
``firedrake-configure``. For example::

   $ python3 firedrake-configure --show-petsc-configure-options --arch complex


Optional dependencies
---------------------

SLEPc
~~~~~

To install Firedrake with SLEPc support you should:

#. Pass ``--download-slepc`` when running PETSc ``configure`` (see :ref:`Installing PETSc<install_petsc>`)::

   $ python3 ../firedrake-configure --show-petsc-configure-options | xargs -L1 ./configure --download-slepc

#. Set ``SLEPC_DIR``::

   $ export SLEPC_DIR=$PETSC_DIR/$PETSC_ARCH

#. Continue with the installation as normal but remove slepc4py from the pip cache
   and install Firedrake with the ``slepc`` optional dependency. For example::

   $ pip cache remove slepc4py
   $ pip install --no-binary h5py 'firedrake[check,slepc]'

VTK
~~~

To install Firedrake with VTK, it should be installed using the ``vtk`` optional
dependency. For example::

   $ pip install --no-binary h5py 'firedrake[check,vtk]'

At present VTK wheels are not available for ARM Linux machines. Depending on your
Python version you may be able to work around this by downloading and pip installing
the appropriate ``.whl`` file from
`here <https://github.com/scientificcomputing/vtk-aarch64/releases>`__.


PyTorch
~~~~~~~

To install Firedrake with `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_, it should be installed
using the ``torch`` optional dependency. For example::

   $ pip install --no-binary h5py 'firedrake[check,torch]' --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

Observe that, in addition to specifying ``torch``, an additional
argument (``--extra-index-url``) is needed. More information on installing
PyTorch can be found `here <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`__.


JAX
~~~

To install Firedrake with JAX, it should be installed using the ``jax`` optional
dependency. For example::

   $ pip install --no-binary h5py 'firedrake[check,jax]'


Netgen
~~~~~~

To install Firedrake with `Netgen <https://ngsolve.org/>`_ support, it should be
installed with the ``netgen`` optional dependency. For example::

   $ pip install --no-binary h5py 'firedrake[check,netgen]'


Customising PETSc
-----------------

Since ``firedrake-configure`` only outputs a string of options it is straightforward
to customise the options that are passed to PETSc ``configure``. You can either:

* Append additional options when ``configure`` is invoked. For example, to
  build PETSc with support for 64-bit indices you should run::

   $ python3 ../firedrake-configure --show-petsc-configure-options | xargs -L1 ./configure --with-64-bit-indices

* Write the output of ``firedrake-configure`` to a file than can be modified. For example::

   $ python3 ../firedrake-configure --show-petsc-configure-options > my_configure_options.txt
   <edit my_configure_options.txt>
   $ cat my_configure_options.txt | xargs -L1 ./configure

.. note::
   If additional options are passed to ``configure`` then care must be taken when
   using externally-installed system packages (i.e. ``--with-package=...`` or
   ``--with-package-{include,lib}=...`` are in the ``configure`` options) as they
   may no longer be suitable for the new configuration. It is your responsibility
   to either ensure that the configuration is suitable, or replace the
   ``configure`` option with ``--download-package`` so that PETSc will download
   and install the right thing.

Reconfiguring an existing PETSc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If rebuilding an existing PETSc installation, rather than removing everything and
starting from scratch, it can be useful to modify and run the ``reconfigure-ARCH.py``
Python script that PETSc generates. This can be found in
``$PETSC_DIR/$PETSC_ARCH/lib/petsc/conf``. Other example scripts can be found in
``$PETSC_DIR/config/examples`` directory.

.. _alternative_install:

Alternative installation methods
================================

If for some reason you are unable to install Firedrake natively using pip,
Firedrake has a number of alternative mechanisms that you can use to obtain
an environment to run your Firedrake code.

Docker
------

Firedrake provides a number of different
`Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ images that can be found
`here <https://hub.docker.com/u/firedrakeproject>`__. The main images best
suited for users are:

* `firedrake-vanilla-default <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/firedrakeproject/firedrake-vanilla-default>`__: a complete Firedrake installation with ARCH ``default``
* `firedrake-vanilla-complex <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/firedrakeproject/firedrake-vanilla-complex>`__: a complete Firedrake installation with ARCH ``complex``
* `firedrake <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/firedrakeproject/firedrake>`__: the firedrake-vanilla-default image with extra downstream packages installed

To use one of the containers you should run::

   $ docker pull firedrakeproject/<image name>:latest

to download the most recent image (replacing ``<image name>`` with the desired
image). Then you can run::

   $ docker run -it firedrakeproject/<image name>:latest

to start and enter a container.

.. note::

   The 'full-fat' ``firedrakeproject/firedrake`` image only exists for x86
   architectures because some external packages do not provide ARM wheels.
   If you are using an ARM Mac (i.e. M1, M2, etc) then you are encouraged to
   use the ``firedrakeproject/firedrake-vanilla-default`` or
   ``firedrakeproject/firedrake-vanilla-complex`` images instead.

It is possible to use `Microsoft VSCode <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__
inside a running container. Instructions for how to do this may be found
`here <https://github.com/firedrakeproject/firedrake/wiki/Writing-Firedrake-code-with-VSCode-inside-a-Docker-container>`__.

.. warning::

   The Docker daemon runs with superuser privileges and so has the potential to 
   damage your system, in particular if volumes are mounted between the container
   and host. We therefore strongly advise you to take care when using Docker.
   More information can be found
   `here <https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface>`__.

Google Colab
------------

Firedrake can also be used inside the brower using Jupyter notebooks and
`Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/>`_. For more information
please see :doc:`here</notebooks>`.

.. _dev_install:

Developer install
=================

.. only:: release

   .. warning::
      You are currently looking at the documentation for the current stable
      release of Firedrake. For the most recent developer documentation you
      should follow the instructions `here <https://firedrakeproject.org/firedrake/install>`__.

In order to install a development version of Firedrake the following steps
should be followed:

#. Install system dependencies :ref:`as before<install_system_dependencies>`

#. Clone and build the *default branch* of PETSc:

   .. code-block:: text

      $ git clone https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc.git
      $ cd petsc
      $ python3 ../firedrake-configure --show-petsc-configure-options | xargs -L1 ./configure
      $ make PETSC_DIR=/path/to/petsc PETSC_ARCH=arch-firedrake-default all
      $ make check
      $ cd ..

#. Clone Firedrake::

   $ git clone <firedrake url>

   where ``<firedrake url>`` is ``https://github.com/firedrakeproject/firedrake.git``
   or ``git@github.com:firedrakeproject/firedrake.git`` as preferred.

#. Set the necessary environment variables::

   $ export $(python3 firedrake-configure --show-env)

#. Install petsc4py and Firedrake's other build dependencies:

   .. code-block:: text

      $ pip cache remove petsc4py
      $ pip install $PETSC_DIR/src/binding/petsc4py
      $ pip install -r ./firedrake/requirements-build.txt

#. Install Firedrake in editable mode without build isolation::

   $ pip install --no-build-isolation --no-binary h5py --editable './firedrake[check]'

Editing subpackages
-------------------

Firedrake dependencies can be cloned and installed in editable mode in an
identical way to Firedrake. For example, to install
`FIAT <https://github.com/firedrakeproject/fiat.git>`_ in editable mode you
should run::

   $ git clone <fiat url>
   $ pip install --editable ./fiat

For most packages it should not be necessary to pass ``--no-build-isolation``.

It is important to note that these packages **must be installed after Firedrake**.
This is because otherwise installing Firedrake will overwrite the just-installed
package.

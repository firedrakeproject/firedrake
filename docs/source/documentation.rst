   Jupyter notebooks
   -----------------

   In addition to the documented tutorials, we also have some `Jupyter
   notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`__ that are a more interactive way of
   getting to know Firedrake. They are described in more detail :doc:`on
   their own page <notebooks>`.

   Youtube Channel
   ---------------
   Firedrake has a `youtube channel <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwwT3kL0HHCv_O3VaeX3GUg>`__ where recorded tutorials are occasionally uploaded.

   API documentation
   =================

   The complete list of all the classes and methods in Firedrake is
   available at the :doc:`firedrake` page. The same information is
   :ref:`indexed <genindex>` in alphabetical order. Another very
   effective mechanism is the site :ref:`search engine <search>`.

Transport for London tickets
----------------------------

Transport for London (TfL) has an integrated public transport
ticketing system, through which fares can be paid in various ways.

   :align: left

Contactless card
================

If you have a credit or debit card with contactless capability (the
symbol on the left), then you can use this directly as a public
transport ticket. Just touch the yellow card reader at the barriers
when entering and leaving a station, or when getting onto a bus. Your
card will be charged once per day with the total of your journeys, and
daily capping guarantees that this is the cheapest way to pay. For
more details see the `TfL contactless payment website
<https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/contactless>`_.

Oyster card
===========

If you lack a contactless card, you can get an Oyster card, which is
TfL's prepay contactless card. You can get one at ticket machines at
London Underground stations. There is a deposit of £3 and you also
need to load some money onto the card. As a guide, the zone 1 tube
fare is £2.30 and the daily cap for zone 1 is £6.40. You can get a
refund of your deposit and up to £10 of fare credit from a ticket
machine at an Underground station when you leave. For more
information, see the `TfL Oyster website
<https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/oyster>`_.

Single tickets
==============

As a last resort, you can buy single tickets from ticket machines at
Underground stations. Note that this can cost **twice** or more the
contactless/Oyster fare. Buses in London do not take cash payments.

Getting to FEniCS '15
---------------------

From Heathrow
=============

Take the Piccadilly Line of the Underground direct to Gloucester Road
station. This is **much** cheaper than the Heathrow Express and avoids
the need to change trains. Both routes take around 50 minutes. You can
use contactless or Oyster on the Underground, but not on the Heathrow
Express.

From Gatwick
============

Take the train to Victoria Station and then the Circle or District line to
South Kensington or Gloucester Road. You need a separate train ticket
to get to Victoria, as Gatwick is not in London. The Southern service
to Victoria is substantially cheaper than the Gatwick Express, and
takes around the same time.

From Stansted
=============

Take the Stansted Express to London Liverpool Street Station and take
the Circle Line towards Tower Hill and Embankment. Get off at South
Kensington or Gloucester Road. You will need a separate train ticket
to get to Liverpool Street as Stansted is not in London.

From the Eurostar
=================

The Eurostar arrives at St Pancras Station. Take the Piccadilly Line
straight to South Kensington or Gloucester Road.

Getting to the workshop dinner
------------------------------

The workshop dinner is at Doggett's Coat and Badge, 1 Blackfriars
Bridge London SE1 9UD. We'll be on the top floor in the terrace
bar. There are several good ways of getting from Imperial to
Doggett's.

By Underground
==============

Take the Circle or District line to Blackfriars. Come out of the main
(North) entrance and turn right. Cross Blackfriars Bridge and
Doggett's is right next to the Bridge on the right (West) side of the
bridge.

By the city bike scheme
=======================

Some of the organisers will be cycling to Doggett's, and you are
welcome to join us using London's city bike scheme `Santander Cycles
<https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/santander-cycles>`_. It's 6.5km, flat
and the traffic is mostly light, except when we cross Westminster
Bridge. A Santander cycle will cost £2-£4 depending on how long it
takes us.

On foot
=======

Some of the locals will lead a walking group. The 6.5 km walk to
Doggett's will take you through Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, Green
Park and St James' Park. You walk past Buckingham Palace and
Parliament Square, over Westminster Bridge and along the South bank of
the Thames. There will be time to make the walk between the public
lecture and Doggett's before dinner.

All Firedrake development is managed on GitHub and Slack...

Deciding what to fix
--------------------

If you are interested in making your first contribution to Firedrake but don't
know what to fix please take a look at our (extensive!)
`list of issues <https://github.com/firedrakeproject/firedrake/issues>`__. In
particular look out for issues labelled as a
`'good first issue' <https://github.com/firedrakeproject/firedrake/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22>`__.
Once you've chosen one to attempt to fix please comment on the issue thread
to notify us and so we can give you advice.

If you already know what you want to fix then great! Before you begin please
do :doc:`get in touch<contact>` on Slack or GitHub discussions so we know
that it is happening.

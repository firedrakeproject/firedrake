Firedrake '18

We are very happy to announce that
the second Firedrake user and developer workshop will be held on 7

The workshop will provide the opportunity for Firedrake users and
developers to engage with each other to communicate the ways that
Firedrake can be used in simulation science, the latest developments
in the project, and the future developments anticipated. The event
will provide Firedrake users with the opportunity to spend face to

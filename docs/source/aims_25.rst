.. title:: Finite Element Course at AIMS Rwanda

Finite Element Course at AIMS Rwanda
------------------------------------

The Firedrake Team will be delivering a finite element course, with practical
examples in Firedrake (of course!) at the `African Institute for Mathematical
Sciences Rwanda <https://aims.ac.rw>`__ from 8 to 12 April 2025.

Course programme
----------------

The course will draw heavily on the materials for a `finite element course
taught at Imperial College London <https://finite-element.github.io>`__ and the
`Firedrake manual
<https://www.firedrakeproject.org/documentation.html#manual>`__.

The materials most relevant for each section are linked below, but further
reading is available on the links above.

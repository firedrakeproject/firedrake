Solving partial differential equations with Firedrake
-----------------------------------------------------

We will host a 2.5-day in-person tutorial on Firedrake at the
`Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford
<https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk>`__ from 18-20 March 2026. This training event is kindly supported by the `Collaborative Computational Project on Data-centric Computational Mechanics <https://ccp-dcm.github.io/>`__ and the `Computational Science Centre for Research Communities (CoSeC) <https://www.cosec.ac.uk/>`__.

The tutorial is aimed at all levels, from MSc students to senior faculty and those solving partial differential equations in industry. Only a basic passing knowledge of finite elements is necessary, although of course knowing more background is still useful.

The course will cover both the basics of solving stationary and time-dependent problems, as well as various advanced topics like geometric multigrid and 𝑝-multigrid solvers, high-order mesh generation and adaptive mesh refinement with Netgen, nonlinear problems, mixed formulations and block preconditioners, eigenvalue problems, and adjoints.

Attendees will need to bring a laptop. Installing Firedrake (see the
:doc:`download page <install>` for details) is optional, as it will be
also be possible to join the tutorial using the cloud. Installing `Paraview <https://www.paraview.org>`__ for visualisation before the course is recommended.


Registration
------------

Registration of £25 covers tea, coffee, and biscuits. `Registration is now open on the Oxford online store <https://www.oxforduniversitystores.co.uk/product-catalogue/mathematical-institute/events/solving-partial-differential-equations-with-firedrake>`__.


Where and when
--------------

The conference will take place in the Andrew Wiles Building. Its main entrance
is located on Woodstock Road (`see here for the precise location
<https://what3words.com/policy.rises.bets>`__). Take some care in navigation, as
Google Maps sometimes directs people to the old mathematics building on St.
Giles.

The course will begin at 13:00 on March 18 and end at 16:00 on March 20.

Travel to Oxford
----------------

(This advice is an adaptation of `Mike Giles' advice <https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/~gilesm/travel.html>`__.)

Coming to Oxford from abroad, the best options are:

* Flying to Heathrow

   This is usually the best option for those flying long distance. There is an excellent `direct bus service to Oxford <https://www.theairlineoxford.co.uk/oxford-to-heathrow-bus/>`__ (when you approach the bus the driver will ask which stop in Oxford you want; tell the driver you want to go to Gloucester Green bus station, "Gloucester" is pronounced "gloster") with 2-3 buses per hour taking 80-90 minutes from the Heathrow Central Bus Station (Terminals 1-3) and Terminal 5. Those flying into Terminal 4 must first change and take local transport at Heathrow to get to Terminal 5.

* Flying to Birmingham

   This is a good option for European flights; Birmingham is a much smaller airport than Heathrow and is more convenient. There is a `regular train service to Oxford from the adjacent Birmingham International station <https://www.crosscountrytrains.co.uk/>`__. There is usually one train per hour, and they take about an hour. The trains can get quite busy, booking in advance is advisable.

Other, less convenient options are:

* Flying to Gatwick: the direct bus service is less frequent and takes up to 2.5 hours.
* Flying to Luton or Stansted: two more airports near London but neither has convenient public transport links to Oxford.
* Eurostar train to St Pancras station in London: onward travel to Oxford requires a 30-minute underground train journey to Paddington station, then an hour's train journey to Oxford.

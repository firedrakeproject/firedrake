Firedrake '25
-------------

The tenth Firedrake user and developer workshop will be held at the
`School of Mathematics <https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths>`__ together
with
`Leeds Institute of Fluid Dynamics <https://fluids.leeds.ac.uk/>`__,
University of Leeds, from 15-17 September 2025.

The workshop will be an opportunity for Firedrake users and developers
to discuss the latest developments in the project, anticipated future
developments, and how Firedrake can be used in the numerical solution
of partial differential equations. The event will provide Firedrake
users with the opportunity to interact directly with developers and
with other users.

The conference will begin around lunchtime on 15 September and end on the
evening of 17 September.

Travel to Leeds
----------------

Coming to Leeds from abroad, the best options are:

* Fly to Heathrow or Gatwick

  This is usually the best option for those flying long distance. Subsequently,
  one can take the train to Leeds.

* Fly to Leeds-Bradford (LBA)

  This is a good option for European flights; Leeds-Bradford is a much smaller
  airport than Heathrow and is more convenient. There is a bus service to the
  centre of Leeds. Alternatively, one can take a taxi.

If coming from the UK it is simplest to take the train to Leeds station.

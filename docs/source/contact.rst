Getting in touch

Should you wish to get in touch with the Firedrake development team,
for help, feature requests, bugs, or just to say hello, you can do so
in a number of different ways.

Mailing list
------------

You can contact the entire development team on the Firedrake mailing
list: firedrake@imperial.ac.uk.  Note that you must be subscribed to
this list to post to it.  To do so, visit `this page
<mailing_list_>`_.

Issues and feature requests
---------------------------

The best place to submit bug reports or feature requests is on the
`github project page <github_>`_.  We're happy to accept third-party
contributions to Firedrake.

Much of the day to day development discussion for Firedrake takes
place on our `slack channel <https://firedrakeproject.slack.com>`__.
This is open to all, but you must request an invite to join the
channel, which you can do by `visiting this page
<https://firedrakeproject.herokuapp.com/>`__ (or clicking the slack
badge above).  Should this not work for whatever reason, please get in
touch via the mailing list.

The `slack IRC gateway
<https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201727913-Connecting-to-Slack-over-IRC-and-XMPP>`__
is enabled for this channel, so you can connect via IRC if you wish
after signing up.

Getting in touch
================

Should you wish to get in touch with the Firedrake development team,
for help, feature requests, bugs, or just to say hello, you can do so
in a number of different ways.

GitHub discussions
------------------

The go to place for asking for help is `GitHub discussions
<https://github.com/firedrakeproject/firedrake/discussions>`__. For support,
please ask a question under the `Firedrake support category
<https://github.com/firedrakeproject/firedrake/discussions/categories/firedrake-support>`__.
We're also always very happy to accept third-party contributions to Firedrake.

Slack
-----

Much of the day to day development discussion for Firedrake takes
place on our `slack channel <https://firedrakeproject.slack.com>`__.
This is open to all, but you must `request an invite to join
<https://join.slack.com/t/firedrakeproject/shared_invite/zt-1l5285niq-19X6q91WcU16vuod~EOj8w>`__
the channel. Should this not work for whatever reason, please get in
touch via `GitHub discussions
<https://github.com/firedrakeproject/firedrake/discussions>`__.


Mailing list
------------

Please join the Firedrake mailing list: firedrake@imperial.ac.uk.  This is a
very low traffic list but it does carry important announcements, for example
when we change a user-facing interface. Join the list on `this page
<mailing_list_>`_.

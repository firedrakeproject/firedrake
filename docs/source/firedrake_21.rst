Firedrake '21

We are very happy to announce that the fifth Firedrake user and
developer workshop will be held online between 15-17 September 2021.

The workshop will provide the opportunity for Firedrake users and
developers to engage with each other to communicate the ways that
Firedrake can be used in simulation science, the latest developments
in the project, and the future developments anticipated. The event
will provide Firedrake users with the opportunity to interact directly
with developers and other users.

Firedrake '21
-------------
               
The fifth Firedrake user and
developer workshop was held online between 15-17 September 2021.

The workshop was an opportunity for Firedrake users and
developers to engage with each other to communicate the ways that
Firedrake can be used in simulation science, the latest developments
in the project, and the future developments anticipated. The event
provided Firedrake users with the opportunity to interact directly
with developers and other users.

   Introduction
   ------------

Firedrake is an automated system for the portable solution of partial
differential equations using the finite element method (FEM). Firedrake
enables users to employ a wide range of discretisations to an infinite
variety of PDEs and employ either conventional CPUs or GPUs to obtain
the solution.

Firedrake employs the Unifed Form Language (UFL) and FEniCS Form
Compiler (FFC) from `the FEniCS Project <http://fenicsproject.org>`_
while the parallel execution of FEM assembly is accomplished by the
`PyOP2 <http://op2.github.io/PyOP2/>`_ system. The global mesh data
structures, as well as linear and non-linear solvers, are provided by
`PETSc <https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/>`_.

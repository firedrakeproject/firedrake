Introduction to Firedrake
-------------------------

We will be hosting an in-person tutorial at Imperial College London
for new users to get to grips with Firedrake.

Tutorial contents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tutorial is primarily aimed at postgraduate students, especially MSc
students who expect to use Firedrake in their summer projects. However,
non-students are also welcome.

We'll be working through the :doc:`Firedrake tutorial notebooks
<notebooks>`, which you can have a look at if you'd like to understand
the scope of the course. We won't assume you're familiar with the
notebooks in advance of the tutorial.

Attendees will need to bring a laptop. Installing Firedrake (see the
:doc:`download page <install>` for details) is optional, as it will be
also be possible to join the tutorial using the cloud.

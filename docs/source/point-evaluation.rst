Point evaluation
================

Firedrake can evaluate :py:class:`~.Function`\s at arbitrary physical
points.  This feature can be useful for the evaluation of the result
of a simulation.  Two APIs are offered to this feature: a
Firedrake-specific one, and one from UFL.


Firedrake API
-------------

Firedrake offers a convenient API for evaluating functions at
arbitrary points via :meth:`~.Function.at`:

.. code-block:: python3

   # evaluate f at a 1-dimensional point
   f.at(0.3)

   # evaluate f at two 1-dimensional points, or at one 2-dimensional point
   # (depending on f's geometric dimension)
   f.at(0.2, 0.4)

   # evaluate f at one 2-dimensional point
   f.at([0.2, 0.4])

   # evaluate f at two 2-dimensional point
   f.at([0.2, 0.4], [1.2, 0.5])

   # evaluate f at two 2-dimensional point (same as above)
   f.at([[0.2, 0.4], [1.2, 0.5]])

While in these examples we have only shown lists, other *iterables*
such as tuples and ``numpy`` arrays are also accepted. The following
are equivalent:

.. code-block:: python3

   f.at(0.2, 0.4)
   f.at((0.2, 0.4))
   f.at([0.2, 0.4])
   f.at(numpy.array([0.2, 0.4]))

For a single point, the result is a ``numpy`` array, or a tuple of
``numpy`` arrays in case of *mixed* functions.  When evaluating
multiple points, the result is a list of values for each point.
To summarise:

* Single point, non-mixed: ``numpy`` array
* Single point, mixed: tuple of ``numpy`` arrays
* Multiple points, non-mixed: list of ``numpy`` arrays
* Multiple points, mixed: list of tuples of ``numpy`` arrays


Points outside the domain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When any point is outside the domain of the function,
:py:class:`.PointNotInDomainError` exception is raised. If
``dont_raise=True`` is passed to :meth:`~.Function.at`, the result is
``None`` for those points which fall outside the domain.

.. code-block:: python3

   mesh = UnitIntervalMesh(8)
   f = mesh.coordinates

   f.at(1.2)                   # raises exception
   f.at(1.2, dont_raise=True)  # returns None

   f.at(0.5, 1.2)                   # raises exception
   f.at(0.5, 1.2, dont_raise=True)  # returns [0.5, None]


.. warning::

   Point evaluation on *immersed manifolds* is not supported yet, due
   to the difficulty of specifying a physical point on the manifold.


Evaluation on a moving mesh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you move the mesh, by :doc:`changing the mesh coordinates
<mesh-coordinates>`, then the bounding box tree that Firedrake
maintains to ensure fast point evaluation must be rebuilt.  To do
this, after moving the mesh, call
:meth:`~.MeshGeometry.clear_spatial_index` on the mesh you have just
moved.

Evaluation with a distributed mesh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is limited support for point evaluation when running Firedrake
in parallel. There is no special API, but there are some restrictions:

* Point evaluation is a *collective* operation.
* Each process must ask for the same list of points.
* Each process will get the same values.


UFL API
-------

UFL reserves the function call operator for evaluation:

.. code-block:: python3

   f([0.2, 0.4])

will evaluate :math:`f` at :math:`(0.2, 0.4)`. UFL does not accept
multiple points at once, and cannot configure what to do with a point
which is not in the domain. The advantage of this syntax is that it
works on any :py:class:`~.ufl.core.expr.Expr`, for example:

.. code-block:: python3

   (f*sin(f)([0.2, 0.4])

will evaluate :math:`f \cdot \sin(f)` at :math:`(0.2, 0.4)`.

.. note::

   The expression itself is not translated into C code.  While the
   evaluation of a function uses the same infrastructure as the
   Firedrake API, which uses generated C code, the expression tree is
   evaluated by UFL in Python.

Firedrake '19
-------------
               
We are very happy to announce that the third Firedrake user and
developer workshop will be held on 26 and 27 September 2019 at `Durham
University <https://www.durham.ac.uk/>`_.

The workshop will provide the opportunity for Firedrake users and
developers to engage with each other to communicate the ways that
Firedrake can be used in simulation science, the latest developments
in the project, and the future developments anticipated. The event
will provide Firedrake users with the opportunity to spend face to
face time with developers and other users.

Tutorial
~~~~~~~~

The workshop will start with a half day Firedrake tutorial for
interested new users and the main science programme will start at
lunchtime on 26 September. See the programme for detailed timings.

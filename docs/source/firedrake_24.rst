Firedrake '24
-------------
               
The eighth Firedrake user and developer workshop will be held at the
`Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford
<https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk>`__ from 16-18 September 2024.

The workshop will be an opportunity for Firedrake users and developers
to discuss the latest developments in the
project, anticipated future developments, and how Firedrake can be used
in the numerical solution of partial differential equations. The event
will provide Firedrake users with the opportunity to interact directly
with developers and with other users.

The conference will begin around lunchtime on 16 September and end on the
evening of 18 September.

Conference venue
----------------

The conference will take place in the Andrew Wiles Building. Its main entrance
is located on Woodstock Road (`see here for the precise location
<https://what3words.com/policy.rises.bets>`__). Take some care in navigation, as
Google Maps sometimes directs people to the old mathematics building on St.
Giles.

Accommodation
-------------

We have arranged a number of single en-suite rooms at `Oriel college, Oxford
<https://www.oriel.ox.ac.uk>`__, for the nights of Monday 16 September and Tuesday
17 September. The fee includes breakfast on the following days. Oriel College,
founded in 1326, is one of the constituent colleges of the university of Oxford.
The accommodation is approximately fifteen minutes walk from the Andrew Wiles
Building.


Conference dinner
-----------------

Registration includes a drinks reception and three-course dinner at `Corpus
Christi college, Oxford <https://www.ccc.ox.ac.uk>`__, founded in 1517. The dinner will take place on the
evening of 17 September. Corpus Christi college is right next to Oriel, about
fifteen minutes walk from the Andrew Wiles building.

It is possible during registration to purchase additional tickets for the
dinner, to bring non-registered companions.

Firedrake Tutorial 11 January 2019.
-----------------------------------

The Firedrake team will once again offer a half day Firedrake tutorial
aimed at new Firedrake users.

Where and when
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Friday 11 January, 1400-1700 Huxley 410 on Imperial College
London's South Kensington Campus.

Tutorial contents
-----------------

The tutorial will be an introduction to solving PDEs using the finite
element method with Firedrake. The level will be pitched at new
masters and PhD students just starting to use or develop Firedrake,
though anyone at any career stage is most welcome.

We'll be working through the :doc:`Firedrake tutorial notebooks
<notebooks>`, which you can have a look at if you'd like to understand
the scope of the course. We won't assume you're familiar with the
notebooks in advance of the tutorial.

Installing Firedrake
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You'll need to bring along a laptop with Firedrake installed. If you
have a Mac, Linux or Windows 10 laptop, :doc:`follow the instructions here
<download>` to install Firedrake. If you run into any difficulty,
please :doc:`contact us <contact>`. Alternatively, if you have trouble
installing Firedrake, we'll hold an installation clinic 1300-1400
before the tutorial. If you'll be using a pre Windows 10 laptop, come to the
installation clinic and we'll help you install Firedrake in a virtual
machine.

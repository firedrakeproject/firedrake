We will solve very large instances of the Poisson problem, demonstrating a range of different solver options and assessing their performance for a range of problem sizes. Additional supplimentary material is provided for running scripts on HPC.\n",

    "Using full GMG gives a significant speed up over using multigrid V-cycles as a preconditioner.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can measure the strong scaling performance of the multigrid by choosing a large enough problem and seeing how long it takes to solve on different numbers of processes. In the plot below, the number of DOFs per core is displayed underneath each data point. For a solver that strong scales perfectly, when we use twice as many cores to solve the same size problem, the total runtime should be halved. This perfect scaling is plotted as a dashed line for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows what happens when we use this multigrid solver for a large problem. For this test we set `Nx = 10` and `Nref = 4` to make a problem with 33 076 161 DOFs and solve over multiple nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full multigrid solver strong scales poorly beyond 2 nodes, the reason for this poor scaling is that the solver spends most of its time performing communication solving the problem on the coarse grid in a distributed manner. CG + AMG scales much better, but isn't as fast as using telescoping, which we discuss in the next section.  Designing a solver that is both fast and scalable for a given problem is often very challenging.\n",

    "In this section we show a final variation of the full multigrid solver above, which has advantages for larger problems and on HPC architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key advantage of using geometric multigrid over algebraic multigrid is the ability to use matrix free methods. These methods never assemble the full finite element matrix, which for large problems gives a significant reduction in memory usage. More information on matrix free methods in Firedrake can be found in the [documentation](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/matrix-free.html). On the coarsest mesh of the multigrid hierarchy we can use the `firedrake.AssembledPC` to assemble the finite element matrix, which allows us to use a direct solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final set of solver options also deals with very large problems spread over multiple compute nodes. For a problem with a large multigrid hierarchy, the coarse grid problem is often so small that when it is solved over multiple nodes, the coarse solve spends all its time performing communication, which is slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to let each node solve a local copy of the coarse grid problem, which avoids this communication. This functionality is enabled using the `telescope` preconditioner alongside the assembled preconditioner, as shown below:"

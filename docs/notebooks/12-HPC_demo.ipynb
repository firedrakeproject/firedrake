    "The parameters `Nx`, `Nref` and `degree` defined below have been selected so that the simulation runs on a single core in a notebook. This is not the regime we want to think about in this tutorial, we want to think about very large problems. We will consider how each of these parameters affects the overall prolem size.\n",

    "`Nx` defines our coarse grid in the mesh hierarchy, it is used to construct a coarse cube mesh. The cube will be divided up into $N_x \\times N_x \\times N_x$ smaller cubes and each cube is then (by default) split into 6 tetrahedra giving a total of $6 N_x^3$ cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Nref` parameter determines how many times that mesh is refined to create a mesh hierarchy. Each refinement uniformly divides each tetrahedron into 8 smaller tetrahedra. After $N_{ref}$ refinements there are $8^{N_{ref}}$ times as many cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the degree, which we denote $k$ specifies the polynomial order of the basis functions used to approximate functions in our finite element space. For standard Lagrange elements in 3D each cell has $\\frac{1}{6}(k+1)(k+2)(k+3)$ degrees of freedom per cell. Some of these degrees of freedom (DOFs) are shared with neighbouring cells for a conforming finite element scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "This small notebook example solves a problem with a large number of DOFs, but on HPC we want to solve problems orders of magnitude larger still, by the end of this notebook we will be considering problems larger than 30 000 000 DOFs. When solving problems using Firedrake in parallel, it's worth remembering that performance can be improved by adding more processes (MPI ranks) as long as the number of DOFs remains above [50 000 DOFs per core](https://firedrakeproject.org/parallelism.html#expected-performance-improvements).\n",

    "Removing the KSP iterative solve gives a significant speed up over using multigrid as a preconditioner. Note this is possible since the linear system for Poisson is relatively well conditioned, and is a prototypical problem for multigrid. In general it may not be possible to just use a multigrid preconditioner without a Kylov subspace iterative solver. Designing a fast and scalale solver for a given problem is often very challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can measure the strong scaling performance of the multigrid by choosing a large enough problem and seeing how long it takes to solve on different numbers of processes. In the plot below, the number of DOFs per core is displayed underneath each data point. For a solver that strong scales perfectly, when we use twice as many cores to solve the same size problem should take half as long. This ideal scaling is also plotted as the dashed line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows what happens when we use this multigrid solver for a large problem. For this test we set `Nx = 10` and `Nref = 4` to make a problem with 33 076 161 DOFs and solve over multiple nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full multigrid solver strong scales poorly beyond 2 nodes. A matrix free solver is slightly faster, but still scales poorly. The reason for this poor scaling is that the solver spends most of its time performing communication solving the problem on the coarse grid in a distributed manner. In the next section we show how to overcome this issue using a telescoping solver.\n",

    "One key advantage of using geometric multigrid over algebraic multigrid is the ability to use matrix free methods. These methods never assemble the full finite element matrix, which for large problems gives a significant reduction in memory usage. On the coarsest mesh of the multigrid hierarchy we can use the `firedrake.AssembledPC` to assemble the finite element matrix, which allows us to use a direct solver."

Additional supplimentary material is provided for running scripts on HPC.\n",

    "We can measure the strong scaling performance of the multigrid by choosing a large enough problem and seeing how long it takes to solve on different numbers of processes. In the plot below, the number of DOFs per core is displayed underneath each data point. For a solver that strong scales perfectly, when we use twice as many cores to solve the same size problem, the total runtime should be halved. This perfect scaling is plotted as a dashed line for comparison.\n",

    "\n",
    "One key advantage of using geometric multigrid over algebraic multigrid is the ability to use matrix free methods. These methods never assemble the full finite element matrix, which for large problems gives a significant reduction in memory usage. More information on matrix free methods in Firedrake can be found in the [documentation](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/matrix-free.html). On the coarsest mesh of the multigrid hierarchy we can use the `firedrake.AssembledPC` to assemble the finite element matrix, which allows us to use a direct solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final set of solver options also deals with very large problems spread over multiple compute nodes. For a problem with a large multigrid hierarchy, the coarse grid problem is often so small that when it is solved over multiple nodes, the coarse solve spends all its time performing communication, which is slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to let each node solve a local copy of the coarse grid problem, which avoids this communication. This functionality is enabled using the `telescope` preconditioner alongside the assembled preconditioner, as shown below:"

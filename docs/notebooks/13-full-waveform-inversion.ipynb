    "Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a high-resolution seismic technique used to estimate the physical parameters in a subsurface region. It is a wave-equation-based technique that searches for an optimal match between observed and computed data. The former is recorded by receivers in the field, whereas the latter consists of computed estimates of propagated waves emitted by a specified wave source. The observed data at the receivers are subject to the influences of the subsurface medium, while waves propagate from the source. Synthetic data can be generated by propagating the source waves in an estimated medium, and therefore, the minimisation of the differences between the observed and synthetic data at the receivers is a methodology for seeking the medium properties of a region. \n",

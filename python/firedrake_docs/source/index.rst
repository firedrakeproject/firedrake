Firedrake is an automated system for the portable solution of partial
differential equations using the finite element method (FEM). Firedrake
enables users to employ a wide range of discretisations to an infinite
variety of PDEs and employ either conventional CPUs or GPUs to obtain
the solution.

Firedrake employs the Unifed Form Language (UFL) and FEniCS Form
Compiler (FFC) from `the FEniCS Project <http://fenicsproject.org>`_
and fields and meshes from `Fluidity
<http://amcg.ese.ic.ac.uk/fluidity>`_. The parallel execution of the
FEM solver is accomplished by the `PyOP2
<https://github.com/OP2/PyOP2>`_ system.

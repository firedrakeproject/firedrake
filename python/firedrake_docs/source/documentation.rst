Getting started
===============

The first step is to download and install Firedrake and its
dependencies. For full instructions, see :doc:`obtaining Firedrake
<download>`.

Tutorials
=========

Once you've built Firedrake, you'll want to actually solve some
PDEs. Below are a few tutorial examples to get you started.

*  :doc:`A basic Helmholtz equation <demos/helmholtz.py>`
*  :doc:`The Burgers equation <demos/burgers.py>`, a non-linear, unsteady example.
*  :doc:`A mixed formulation of the Poisson equation <demos/poisson_mixed.py>`

Manual
======

Once you have worked through the tutorials, the user manual is the
next step.  It goes in to more detail on how to set up and solve
finite element problems in Firedrake.

API documentation
=================

The complete list of all the classes and methods in Firedrake is
available at the :doc:`firedrake` page. The same information is
:ref:`indexed <genindex>` in alphabetical order. Another very
effective mechanism is the site :ref:`search engine <search>`.

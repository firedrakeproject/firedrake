# There are a number of local hacks in this file, to deal with the multiple
# ways in which setup.py is called by various scripts and packaging methods
# that interact with spud, enabling setuptools to grok their intentions.

# In some cases, we will be passed a 'DESTDIR' from an upstream packagaing
# system. This will be a local directory to install into, and act as local '/'
# as far as all paths are concerned. Check for this, and fail nicely if not set.

# We may also be given prefix, either as a configuration option (which will be
# dealt with by substitutions later) or as a command line option. If a command
# line option is present, parse this. In some cases, just to add spice into the
# mix, PREFIX is supplied twice - once by configure, and again by a parent
# Makefile as a command-line flag.
#
# As an alternative to DESTDIR being set, Debian packaging calls setup.py with
# a --root command line option which does the same thing. This needs to be
# parsed if present, and supercedes any previous DESTDIR picked up from
# environment.

#   * configure-supplied prefixes are dealt with by substitution directly into
#       this file, with @ PREFIX @ being replaced.
#   * prefixes as command-line options are pushed by us
#
# Note that in the case of this and other packages which supply prefix twice
# (once in configure, and then again on the command line) we honour the prefix
# on the command line in preference to the configure prefix.

# explicitly DOES NOT collect such reference cycles (even though it
# can deal with normal cycles).  Quoth the documentation:
#
#     Objects that have __del__() methods and are part of a reference
#     cycle cause the entire reference cycle to be uncollectable,
#     including objects not necessarily in the cycle but reachable
#     only from it.
#
# To get around this, since the default __del__ on Expr is just
# "pass", we just remove the method from the definition of Expr.

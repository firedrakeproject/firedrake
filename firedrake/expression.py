class Expression(ufl.Coefficient):
    r"""Python function that may be evaluated on a
    :class:`.FunctionSpace`. This provides a mechanism for setting
    :class:`.Function` values to user-determined values.

    Expressions should very rarely be needed in Firedrake, since using
    the same mathematical expression in UFL is usually possible and
    will result in much faster code.

    To use an Expression, we can either :meth:`~.Function.interpolate`
    it onto a :class:`.Function`, or :func:`.project` it into a
    :class:`.FunctionSpace`.  Note that not all
    :class:`.FunctionSpace`\s support interpolation, but all do
    support projection.

    Expressions are specified by creating a subclass of
    :class:`Expression` with a user-defined `eval`` method. For
    example, the following expression sets the output
    :class:`.Function` to the square of the magnitude of the
    coordinate:

    .. code-block:: python

        class MyExpression(Expression):
            def eval(self, value, X):
                value[:] = numpy.dot(X, X)

    Observe that the (single) entry of the ``value`` parameter is written to,
    not the parameter itself.

    This :class:`Expression` could be interpolated onto the
    :class:`.Function` ``f`` by executing:

    .. code-block:: python

        f.interpolate(MyExpression())

    Note the brackets required to instantiate the ``MyExpression`` object.

    If a Python :class:`Expression` is to set the value of a
    vector-valued :class:`.Function` then it is necessary to explicitly
    override the :meth:`value_shape` method of that
    :class:`Expression`. For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        class MyExpression(Expression):
            def eval(self, value, X):
                value[:] = X

            def value_shape(self):
                return (2,)

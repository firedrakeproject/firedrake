class Expression(ufl.Coefficient):
    """A code snippet that may be evaluated on a :class:`.FunctionSpace`.

    The code in an :class:`Expression` has access to the coordinates
    in the variable ``x``, with ``x[0]`` corresponding to the x
    component, ``x[1]`` to the y component and so forth.  You can use
    mathematical functions from the C library, along with the variable
    ``pi`` for :math:`\\pi`.

    For example, to build an expression corresponding to

    .. math::

       \\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y)\\sin(\\pi z)

    we use:

    .. code-block:: python

       expr = Expression('sin(pi*x[0])*sin(pi*x[1])*sin(pi*x[2])')

    To use an Expression, we can either :meth:`~Function.interpolate`
    it onto a :class:`.Function`, or :func:`.project` it into a
    :class:`.FunctionSpace`.  Note that not all
    :class:`.FunctionSpace`\s support interpolation, but all do
    support projection.

    If the :class:`FunctionSpace` the expression will be applied to is
    vector valued, a list of code snippets of length matching the
    number of components in the function space must be provided.

"""Computation dof numberings for extruded meshes
==============================================

On meshes with a constant number of cell layers (i.e. each column
contains the same number of cells), it is possible to compute all the
correct numberings by just lying to DMPlex about how many degrees of
freedom there are on the base topological entities.

This ceases to be true as soon as we permit variable numbers of cells
in each column, since now, although the number of degrees of freedom
on a cell does not change from column to column, the number that are
stacked up on each topological entity does change.

This module implements the necessary chicanery to deal with it.

Computation of topological layer extents
----------------------------------------

First, a picture.

Consider a one-dimensional mesh::

    x---0---x---1---x---2---x

Extruded to form the following two-dimensional mesh::


                         x--------x
                         |        |
                         |        |
   2                     |        |
                         |        |
       x--------x--------x--------x
       |        |        |
       |        |        |
   1   |        |        |
       |        |        |
       x--------x--------x
       |        |
       |        |
   0   |        |
       |        |
       x--------x

This is constructed by providing the number of cells in each column as
well as the starting cell layer::

     [[0, 2],
      [1, 1],
      [2, 1]]

We need to promote this cell layering to layering for all topological
entities.  Our solution to "interior" facets that only have one side
is to require that they are geometrically zero sized, and then
guarantee that we never iterate over them.  We therefore need to keep
track of two bits of information, the layer extent for allocation
purposes and also the layer extent for iteration purposes.

We compute both by iterating over the cells and transferring cell
layers to points in the closure of each cell.  Allocation bounds use
min-max on the cell bounds, iteration bounds use max-min.

To simplify some things, we require that the resulting mesh is not
topologically disconnected anywhere.  Offset cells must, at least,
share a vertex with some other cell.

Computation of function space allocation size
---------------------------------------------

With the layer extents computed, we need to compute the dof
allocation.  For this, we need the number of degrees of freedom *on*
the base topological entity, and *above* it in each cell::

       x-------x
       |   o   |
       o   o   o
       o   o   o
       |   o   |
       o---o---o

This element has one degree of freedom on each base vertex and cell,
two degrees of freedom "above" each vertex, and four above each cell.
To compute the number of degrees of freedom on the column of
topological entities we sum the number on the entity, multiplied by
the number of layers with the number above, multiplied by the number
of layers minus one (due to the fencepost error difference).
This number of layers naturally changes from entity to entity, and so
we can't compute this up front, but must do it point by point,
constructing the PETSc Section as we go.

Computation of function space maps
----------------------------------

Now we need the maps from topological entities (cells and facets) to
the function space nodes they can see.  The allocation offsets that
the numbering section gives us are wrong, because when we have a step
in the column height, the offset will be wrong if we're looking from
the higher cell.  Consider a vertex discretisation on the previous
mesh, with a numbering::

                      8--------10
                      |        |
                      |        |
                      |        |
                      |        |
    2--------5--------7--------9
    |        |        |
    |        |        |
    |        |        |
    |        |        |
    1--------4--------6
    |        |
    |        |
    |        |
    |        |
    0--------3

The cell node map we get by just looking at allocation offsets is::

   [[0, 1, 3, 4],
    [3, 4, 6, 7],
    [6, 7, 9, 10]]

note how the second and third cells have the wrong value for their
"left" vertices.  Instead, we need to shift the numbering we obtain
from the allocation offset by the number of entities we're skipping
over, to result in::

   [[0, 1, 3, 4],
    [4, 5, 6, 7],
    [7, 8, 9, 10]]

Now, when we iterate over cells, we ensure that we access the correct
dofs.  The same trick needs to be applied to facet maps too.

Computation of boundary nodes
-----------------------------

For the top and bottom boundary nodes, we walk over the cells at,
respectively, the top and bottom of the column and pull out those
nodes whose entity height matches the appropriate cell height.  As an
example::

                      8--------10
                      |        |
                      |        |
                      |        |
                      |        |
    2--------5--------7--------9
    |        |        |
    |        |        |
    |        |        |
    |        |        |
    1--------4--------6
    |        |
    |        |
    |        |
    |        |
    0--------3

The bottom boundary nodes are::

   [0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9]

whereas the top are::

   [2, 5, 7, 8, 10]

For these strange "interior" facets, we first walk over the cells,
picking up the dofs in the closure of the base (ceiling) of the cell,
then we walk over facets, picking up all the dofs in the closure of
facets that are exposed (there may be more than one of these in the
cell column).  We don't have to worry about any lower-dimensional
entities, because if a co-dim 2 or greater entity is exposed in a
column, then the co-dim 1 entity in its star is also exposed.

For the side boundary nodes, we can make a simplification: we know
that the facet heights are always the same as the cell column heights
(because there is only one cell in the support of the facet).  Hence
we just walk over the boundary facets of the base mesh, extract out
the nodes on that facet on the bottom cell and walk up the column.
This is guaranteed to pick up all the nodes in the closure of the
facet column.

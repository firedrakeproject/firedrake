"""
Firedrake uses PETSc for its linear and nonlinear solvers.  The
interaction is carried out through DM objects.  These carry around any
user-defined application context and can be used to inform the solvers
how to create field decompositions (for fieldsplit preconditioning) as
well as creating sub-DMs (which only contain some fields), along with
multilevel information (for geometric multigrid)

The way Firedrake interacts with these DMs is, broadly, as follows:

A DM is tied to a :class:`~.FunctionSpace` and remembers what function
space that is.  To avoid reference cycles defeating the garbage
collector, the DM holds a weakref to the FunctionSpace (which holds a
strong reference to the DM).  Use :func:`get_function_space` to get
the function space attached to the DM, and :func:`set_function_space`
to attach it.

Similarly, when a DM is used in a solver, an application context is
attached to it, such that when PETSc calls back into Firedrake, we can
grab the relevant information (how to make the Jacobian, etc...).
This functions in a similar way using :func:`set_appctx` and
:func:`get_appctx` on the DM.  You can set whatever you like in here,
but most of the rest of Firedrake expects to find either ``None`` or
else a :class:`firedrake.solving_utils._SNESContext` object.

A crucial part of this, for composition with multi-level solvers
(``-pc_type mg`` and ``-snes_type fas``) is decomposing the DMs.  When
a field decomposition is created, the callback
:func:`create_field_decomposition` checks to see if an application
context exists.  If so, it splits it apart (one for each of fields)
and attaches these split contexts to the subdms returned to PETSc.
This facilitates runtime composition with multilevel solvers.  When
coarsening a DM, the application context is coarsened and transferred
to the coarse DM.  The combination of these two symbolic transfer
operations allow us to nest geometric multigrid preconditioning inside
fieldsplit preconditioning, without having to set everything up in
advance.
